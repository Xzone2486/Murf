They allow you to label data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. Think of them like labeled boxes where you can put stuff in to use later.",

    "summary": "Loops are used to repeat a block of code. For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then rather than typing the same code 100 times, you can use a loop. In Python, we have 'while' loops and 'for' loops. A 'for' loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).",
